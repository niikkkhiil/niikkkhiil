        " Vectorization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Vectorization in NumPy refers to the process of performing operations on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops. This is achieved by leveraging low-level optimizations in C, which makes the operations much faster compared to traditional Python loops. Here are the key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        " Speed: Vectorized operations are significantly faster because they are executed in compiled code rather than interpreted Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplicity: Code becomes more concise and easier to read, as complex operations can be expressed in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        " Efficiency: Reduces the overhead of Python loops and function calls, leading to better performance.\n",

        "```\n",
        " Broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that allows operations on arrays of different shapes. When performing operations, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array without making unnecessary copies of data. This enables efficient and flexible array operations.\n",

        " How Broadcasting Works\n",
        " Broadcasting follows these rules:\n",
